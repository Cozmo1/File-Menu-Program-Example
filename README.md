# File-Menu-Program-Example
File Menu Program Example with all its sub-files.

Note: you must 'KEEP' these files in the same folder or directory. Next make sure to put any 'wave' sounds, which are stored on your Windows computer system into the same folder or directory, so that the File Menu Program Example can be fully appreciated with sound.

Next run the program by 'double-clicking' on the file called 'Modules'.

This Python program example will show you what a file menu program looks like, when you create it out of Python.

I hope you enjoy these repositories and feel free to download any of my Python programs and any Python examples I've created.
